#Malware Downloader

Scripts to attempt HTTP POST/GET to known malware domains.
Use this to test malware detection products at your own risk.

Requirements:

Notes:
* Have a look at the downloaded domain file prior to running this and try to clean it up a bit
* Check the paths in the scripts, files are expected in /root/malware
